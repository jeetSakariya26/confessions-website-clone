# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# overview of Backend Folder : -

it has **index.js** file which contains all the routes of backend
**npm i** ( Install required packages ) 
**nodemon index.js** ( command to start server if you are in backend folder )

## controllers :
this folder contains js files that exports functions responsible for handling server requests, such as fetching, updating, deleting data,etc.

## models :
this folder contains different javaScript files about schema of models.

## service : 
this folder contains user and developer authentication files which use the token stored in the header of the request. (In frontend, this token is stored in localStorage and passed in header whenever required )
there are different tokens for user and developer to authenticate so that a user can never access developer features and vice versa.

## validation :
this folder contains js files to validate the data according to the Schema ( using Joi lib )
